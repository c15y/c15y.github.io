          <b>c15y</b> (<em>pronounced "see-fifteen-why"</em>) stands for <em>countertechnology</em>:
          <p><p>
          "<em>c</em>" + <em>15</em> letters + "<em>y</em>"
          <p>
          Countertechnology is the application of techniques for reducing the harmful effects of unrestrained technological development.
          <p>
          To get along in society today, everyone must conform to the machine interface, to behave like a machine themselves to get along with the machines.  We move at the hyperspeed pace of technology, which ironically wastes our time with constant distractions.  Online services, especially social media, vie for our attention, pushing information to influence what we should like, what we should read, what we should do, when, and with whom.
          <p>
          <b>c15y</b> is countering this trend by creating some special technologies to help people live life on their terms, matching the form and cadence of the human interface.  One important principle of countertechnology is reintermediation: putting a human mediator between you and the machine to serve as a helper, a messenger, a guide or just a shield.
          <p>
          With <b>c15y</b>'s flagship effort, <a href='http://letterthing.com'>Letter Thing</a>, <b>c15y</b> is reviving the lost art of postal letter writing and the helpful operator of the early days of telephony ("How can I direct your letter?") to deliver a new way of communicating over the internet that involves slowing down and writing a letter instead of checking your phone to keep up with the latest trends and minutiae.  You can get letters mailed back in reply, too, creating an open communication channel between you and any group of people without ever needing to turn on a computer.  Use a pen and paper instead, and take your time.
          <p>
          <b>c15y</b> is an asymmetric think tank and R&D lab located in a heavily-armed and brick-reinforced redoubt in Eastern Oregon.
