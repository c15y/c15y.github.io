          Countertechnology is the application of techniques for reducing the harmful effects of unrestrained technological development.
          <p>
          To get along in society today, everyone must conform to the machine interface, to behave like a machine themselves in order to effectively operate the machines.  We move at the hyperspeed pace of technology, and yet technology wastes all our time with technical difficulties, distractions and diversions.  Online services, especially social media, constantly vie for our attention, pushing information to influence what we should like, what we should read, what we should do, when, and with whom.
          <p>
          The smart phone serves as personal augmentation rather than a tool.  The connected device that never strays far from your body replaces real thinking and social interaction with instant encyclopaedia lookup and instant messaging.  If your phone were implanted onto your wrist rather than kept in your pocket, you'd be a cyborg.  The question is, if you become separated from your smart phone -- if you suffered a phonectomy -- would you regain the parts of your consciousness that have now atrophied, gone dark, or would you be left somewhat damaged?
          <p>
          <b>c15y</b> is countering this trend by creating some special technologies to help people live life according to the form and cadence of the human interface -- emphasizing interactions with other people and the natural world rather than computers and corporations.  Countertechnology is not <em>anti</em>-technology.  In fact, <b>c15y</b> vigorously researches, designs and implements new technologies as a general operating principle.
          <p>
          <b>c15y</b>'s research is leading to various threat-reduction methods in response to corporate power, drones, spying and the omnipresent pattern of industrialized violence and exploitation.
          <p>
          One important countertechnological technique is reintermediation: putting a human mediator between you and the machine to serve as a helper, a messenger, a guide or a shield.
          <p>
          With its flagship project, <a href='http://letterthing.com'>Letter Thing</a>, <b>c15y</b> is reviving the lost art of postal letter writing and the helpful operator of the early days of telephony ("How can I direct your letter?") to deliver a new way of communicating over the internet that involves slowing down and writing a letter instead of constantly watching your phone to keep up with the latest trends and social minutiae.  You can get letters mailed back in reply, too, creating an open channel of communication between you and any group of people without ever needing to turn on a computer.  Use a pen and paper instead, and take your time.
          <p>
          <b>c15y</b> is an asymmetric think tank and R&D lab located in a heavily-armed brick stronghold in Eastern Oregon.  Ask us how we can help your company improve profits, and we'll tell you how to f2k off.
